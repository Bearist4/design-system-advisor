# Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Blank Dashboard Screen

If you're seeing a blank dashboard screen, here are the steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for errors:

**Common Errors:**
- `Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser` - Fixed with webpack configuration
- `Failed to load resource: favicon.ico` - Fixed by adding favicon
- Authentication errors - Check Supabase configuration

### 2. Verify Authentication
The dashboard should show:
- Loading spinner initially
- User authentication check
- Token fetching process

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Dashboard: Component mounted, starting initialization...
Dashboard: Checking user authentication...
Dashboard: User check result: { user: {...}, error: null }
Dashboard: User found, setting user state
Dashboard: Fetching tokens...
Dashboard: Tokens fetched successfully: 0
Dashboard: Setting loading to false
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
In browser dev tools, check the Network tab for:
- Failed requests (red entries)
- Authentication requests to Supabase
- Any 500 errors

### 4. Common Fixes Applied

#### Webpack Configuration
```typescript
// next.config.ts
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  if (!isServer) {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      fs: false,
      net: false,
      tls: false,
    };
  }
  return config;
}
```

#### Favicon Fix
- Added `favicon.ico` to the public directory
- Configured proper asset handling

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging
- Better error boundaries
- Graceful fallbacks for failed requests

### 5. Debug Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is set
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set

3. **Test Authentication**
   - Try logging out and logging back in
   - Check if the login page works properly

4. **Database Connection**
   - Verify Supabase database is accessible
   - Check if RLS policies are working

### 6. Expected Dashboard Behavior

**Loading State:**
- Shows spinner with "Loading dashboard..." message
- Should not stay in loading state indefinitely

**Authenticated State:**
- Shows dashboard with statistics cards
- Shows "No tokens uploaded yet" if no data
- Shows token table if data exists

**Error States:**
- Shows "Authentication Required" if not logged in
- Redirects to login if authentication fails

### 7. If Dashboard Still Blank

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify your Supabase configuration** is correct
3. **Run the RLS fix script** if you haven't already
4. **Check if the development server is running** on the correct port

### 8. Quick Test

Try accessing these URLs to verify the app is working:
- `http://localhost:3000/login` - Should show login page
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` - Should redirect to login if not authenticated
- After login, dashboard should load properly

### 9. Still Having Issues?

If the dashboard is still blank after these fixes:

1. **Check the browser console** for the specific error messages
2. **Share the console output** to get more targeted help
3. **Verify your Supabase database** has the correct schema
4. **Test with a fresh browser session** (incognito mode)

The enhanced logging should now provide much more detailed information about what's happening during the dashboard load process.
